Projects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

1. **Emotion Detector from Text:** Used sklearn library in Python for implementing linearSVC classifier to predict the emotion (happy/sad) of person from entered text using CrowdFlower dataset.

2. **Handwritten Digit Recognition:** Used Keras library in Python for implementing Convolution Neural Network to predict hand written digits (0-9) and achieved 99.04% accuracy on MNIST dataset.

3. **Computer generated image Detector:** Implemented Convolution Neural Network to classify Pencil sketch vs Color image of human face. Model got 100% accuracy.
